# Book.io

The book.io software solution is to be developed to replace the current booking solution used by an AirBnB business. The software currently used in an online based system provided by AirBnB. This current solution presents some challenges for the users, as the always online requirement is ill-suited to the environment of the software. The new software therefore, will require offline functionality, as well as all features required to efficiently manage the bookings and guest details. The software also needs to cater for possible expansion to the business, by featuring a multi-user system to allow for Staff to access some information. The scope of this software will include the ability to manage bookings, guest details, house details, staff details and to encrypt all sensitive details stored by the software. These features also need to be complimented by a clean user interface, and a reliable system that ensures no loss of data.
